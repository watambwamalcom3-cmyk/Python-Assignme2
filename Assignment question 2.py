## Question 2: Encapsulation — BankAccount Class##
class BankAccount:

        self.owner = owner
        self.__balance = balance  # private attribute (name-mangled to _BankAccount__balance)

# Demonstration
account = BankAccount("Munyaradzi", 100)
account.display_balance()
account.deposit(50)
account.withdraw(30)
account.withdraw(1000)   # insufficient funds

# Direct access is blocked/hidden:
# print(account.__balance)        # AttributeError
print(account._BankAccount__balance)  # 120.0 — shows name mangling, but you shouldn't rely on this
